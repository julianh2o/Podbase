<LI>To create a new document, there is a little file icon with a plus on it at 
the top of the page, next to the path. Click this to add a new file to this directory.

<LI>Click on a file to view it. Once viewing a file, click the "edit" button
on the right side of the header that comes up to edit the file.  To re-eidt an existing 
page, click the pencil icon to the upper right of the window.

<LI>To save the updates, click the "commit changes" button. You can choose to
dd a message or description of your change if you like.

<LI>When you're done making changes, let Julian know and he can make them live for
you. They will not automatically get synced with the running server.

<LI>These can be HTML files -- copy the template.html form into the HTML document 
you want to create.  This will support the # format usable for indexing.

<LI>The GitHub files can only be renamed by Julian, but they can be copied, deleted 
and then recreated under a different name if need be.

<LI> When finished, click the "Commit new file" at the bottom of the page.
