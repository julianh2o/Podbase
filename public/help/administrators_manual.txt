PODBASE2 ADMINISTRATOR'S MANUAL

This document describes the various administrative levels available in Podbase2.  In practice, 
these are "Roles" consisting  of clusters of check-list style permissions granted under the
Permisssions tab, visible to authorized users. 

1.  The highest is "Root" with authority to delete projects 
	and papers [but not yet users], invite new users and grant "super-user" powers.
	For individual projects, it can assign the role of "Owner", and along with Owners
	can grant the roles of "Manager" and "Template Editor."
	Permission management is granted singly by Root and subsets are granted
	for users with roles of "Owner" "Manager" and "Template editor" 
		
2.  Next highest is "Owner" -- normally the P.I. on a project, with broad authority over a 
	particular project.  

3.  Third is "Manager" -- ordinarily someone closely involved in obtaining the images and 
	responsible for assessing the correctness of entered metadata.

4.  Template Editor" is a separate role, for convenience, gathering all of the template-manipulation
	permisssions together.  These may, as with other permissions, be granted singly as well.

5.  A user with one or more of the Adninistrator's powers will see one or two extra tabs 
	on his/her home page beside the Browser tab:  Manage Templates tab and Permissions tab.



	Under the Permissions tab, several "Roles" check boxes may be used as a quick way to 
select a particular set of permissions, but in general, all of these permsissions can be 
individually set or reset.  They are listed under the lowest-level role that grants them en mass: 

================================================================================================
 	
ROLE - MANAGER: [NOT IMPLEMENTED YET]
	A Manager has elevated access rights to a project. A Manager has control over most aspects, 
as listed in the following specific permissions granted when the Manager role box in the
Permissions tab is clicked by an administrator with Permissions authorization:

	FILE_DELETE: 		
		The user can delete files (images and text files) from this project

	FILE_UPLOAD: 		
		The user can upload files (images and text files)to this project
            (see UPLOAD above for instructions)

	VIEW_TEMPLATES
		User will have a "Template Manager" tab and can see and download the templates 
		for a project.  Other permissions are granted under the Template Manager role.

	SET_TEMPLATE:		
		The user can change the template associated with directories

	EDIT_DATA_METADATA:
		The user can enter, edit and/or delete the original metadata for this
		project (using "Data mode")

	[VIEW PERMISSIONS
		The user (usually a Manager) is allowed to view, but not modify, the permisssions
		for a particular user and project (including his/her own) - NOT IMPLEMENTED YET]

	VIEW_ALL_IMAGES
		The user can browse through, see and download all images and original metadata 
		in a project (does not grant editing rights)

	VIEW_VISIBLE_IMAGES
		The user can browse through, see and download all images and open-access metadata 
		in a project that have been Set Visible by someone with permisssion to do so.
		This can be used to provide a preview of images about to be released to OPEN status.
		Actual release to OPEN requires assigning "guest" user to the project, with
		only VIEW_VISIBLE_IMAGES set -- not VIEW_ALL_IMAGESD.

	LISTED:
		The user has been associated with the project in question.  Being LISTED
		doesn't grant any access whatsoever. It means only that the "add user"
		button has been used to add the user to the project list so that an 
		Owner can set permissions appropriately.

================================================================================================

ROLE - OWNER:
	The user is considered an owner of this project.  In addition to the privileges of a 
Manager, the Owner can add/remove users, manage permissions (except for	 him/herself), as  
well as other privileges listed below:

	EDIT_ANALYSIS_METADATA
		The user can enter, edit and/or delete the PUBLIC metadataset for this project 
		to prepare it for OPEN (currenty called "VISIBLE") status (using "Analysis mode").
		Changes made in Analysis mode do not transfer to the Data mode metadata display.
 
	MANAGE_PERMISSIONS:
		The user is authorized to manage permissions for this project 
			[except for him/herself -- NOT IMPLEMENTED YET]

	SET_VISIBLE:				
		The user has permisssion to toggle "visibility" for images.  Actually control of
		"visibility" (OPEN and pre-open) is made in the View window for each image. 
		Setting VISIBLE tags the image in the browser window with a "[V}" preceding the name.

	SET_DATA_MODE:
		The user can toggle the data mode for a project: Data or Analysis (the latter for
		preparing a project for OPEN access.

	NO_WATERMARK:
		The user can view images without the watermark

================================================================================================

ROLE - TEMPLATE EDITOR
	The template editor controls which templates (attribute llists and definitions) are 
available to a project, creates new ones as needed, changes the order of appearance of 
attribute fields and determines which fields will be "hiddden" until called forth.

	DELETE_TEMPLATES 
		The user can delete templates

	EDIT_TEMPLATES
		The user can edit templates

	CREATE_TEMPLATES
		The user can create templates ether through the Add template link or the Import link

================================================================================================

to Root are:

1. Power to delete projects (Delete link next to project name)

2. Power to create new projects (Add new project link)

3. Power to add new users (Add user link)

	Users are added by clicking the link, then entering their email address (which serves 
as a user name) into the data-inout box.  Clicking "OK" sends the new user log-on instructions 
along with a temporary password. NOTE THAT CURRENTLY SOME MAIL CLIENTS CLASSIFY THE MAIL AS SPAM

 	MANAGE_PERMISSIONS:	to manage all permissions regardless of project
	CREATE_USERS:		to create (but not delete) new users
	CREATE_PAPER:		to create papers on any project
	DELETE_PROJECT:		to delete projects
	CREATE_PROJECT:		to create new projects

and "Template Editor"

	1.  Delete a user

	2.  Reset a user's password (could be done by deleting the user and reinviting him/her)

	3.  The ability to see whether a new user has actually activated their account.

[NOTE:  THe highest level of administration is charged with creating new projects and inviting/deleting users]
