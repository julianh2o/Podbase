		The user can delete files (images and text files) from this project
	PROJECT_FILE_UPLOAD: 		
		The user can upload files (images and text files)to this project
            (see UPLOAD above for instructions)

	PROJECT_SET_TEMPLATE:		
		The user can change the template associated with directories
	DATA EDITOR:
		The user can enter, edit and/or delete the original metadata for this
		project (using "Data mode") [this works now]
	EDITOR
		The user can enter, edit and/or delete the PUBLIC metadataset for this project to prepare it
		for PUBLIC (currenty called "VISIBLE") status (using "Analysis mode") [not implemented yet]
	MANAGE_PERMISSIONS:
		The user is allowed to manage permissions for this project
	ADMINISTRATOR:
		Has elevated access rights to a project: in addition to those granted an "owner"
		an Administrator has authority to add/delete users, manage permissions, delete templates, 
		edit metadata for release to the public, and release project images to the public.
	OWNER:
		The user is considered an owner of this project, ordinarily someone closely
		involved in obtaining the images and respnsible for assessing the correctness
		of entered metadata. An owner has control over most aspects:
		uploading/downloading image files; selecting and managing (editing) templates;
		viewing/downloading images without a watermark; entering/editing the original 
		metadata; viewing (but not altering) permissions of users [not implemented]
		(these permissions are automatically granted with "ownership")	
	VISIBLE:				
		[A user with this permission can view/download project images and metadata.
		-- not implemented this way yet]. This is the minimum access. Current situation:
		This kind of user can also see the directories and any images that
		are set to visible.
	LISTED:
		The user has been associated with the project in question.  Being LISTED
		doesn't grant any access whatsoever. It means only that the "add user"
		button has been used to add the user to the project list so that an 
		Administrator can set permissions appropriately.
	[MAKE [PUBLIC] VISIBLE: - not implemented			
		The user is allowed to mark (or unmark) images, edited metadata and files
		as accessible ("Public" or  currently "Visible") to the public via the "Public" ("Visible") check box that
		will then display with each image]. VISIBLE means that the project appears 
		in lists. This is the minimum access. This kind of user can also see the 
		directories and any images that are set to visible.
							[NOT IMPLEMENTED YET]
[NOTE:  THe highest level of administration is charged with creating new projects and inviting/deleting users

*Create a new issue*

     1. Go to: https://github.com/julianh2o/Podbase and log in if necessary

     2. In the right sidebar, click "Issues" 

     3. On the top right of the screen, click green button "New Issue"

     4. Fill out the title and any comments you have describing the task or
error you're dealing with and click "Submit new issue."

     5.  You can also flag the nature of the issue, close issues, add comments
 to issues, edit the original issue, open a closed issue, etc. etc.


*Access/download the latest version of a Podbase program*

     1. Go to: https://github.com/organizations/ and log in if necessary

     2. In the right sidebar (under "Repositories"), click julisnh2o/Podbase. 
[this did not work for Dan the last time he tried but searching for julianh2o/podbase 
via a link at the bottom of the error page works]

     3.  Alternatively, Go to: https://github.com/julianh2o/Podbase

     4. In the main part of the screen, there is a list of files and
directories. Navigate this list until you find the file/script that you need

     5. Click on the file you need and then click (in the top right corner of the
main window) "raw"

     6. You can now save this file (control-s or apple-s) to where you'd like it
to be. Be sure to maintain the original extension (e.g .jar for Java files)
